# HYDROPHONE DETAILS
# @brief Defines that indicate the setup of the hydrophones
# These variables must be changed according to the hydrophones used.
# As of 03.01.21, three hydrophones of the type Benthowave BII-7014FG 
# is used. See the datasheet at 
# https://www.benthowave.com/products/Specs/BII-7014FGPGDatasheet.pdf
# for more information
# 
# @note It is thought that the hydrophones are
# placed in a form of a triangle. Therefore, we
# have one on front starboard, one on front port
# and one on the stern in the middle. Could be changed
# in the future

# FILTER SETUP
# @brief A fourth-order IIR-filter to filter the data before 
# processing it. By using this filter, we should (hopefully)
# eliminate unwanted frequencies. 
# 
# @warning Must have abs(filter) < 1 to prevent overflow
#
# @warning The filter is designed with the filterdesigner 
# in MATLAB, using
#      Fs    = 112500        Sampling frequency
#      Fc1   = 15000         Lower cut-off frequency
#      Fc2   = 45000         Upper cut-off frequency
#      
#      Order = 4             Filter order
#      Type  = Butterworth   Filter type
#      
# 
# The filter's transferfunction is given as 
#      H(z) = B(z) * 1 / A(z)
# where
#      B(z) = b0 + b1 * z^(-1) + b2 * z^(-2) + b3 * z^(-3) + ...
#      A(z) = 1 + a1 * z^(-1) + a2 * z^(-2) + a3 * z^(-3) + ...
# 
# NOTE: Since the function uses a biquad-filter, every filter with order > 2 is split 
# into multiple serial second-order filters, leaving at most one filter with order = 1 
# 
# Example:
#      4th order filter with the original filter function given as
#      H(z) = B(z)/A(z) with
#
#          B(z) = b0 + b1 * z^(-1) + b2 * z^(-2) + b3 * z^(-3) + b4 * z^(-4)
#          A(z) = 1 + a1 * z^(-1) + a2 * z^(-2) + a3 * z^(-3) + a4 * z^(-4)
#    
#      is instead given as H(z) = B_1(z)/A_1(z) * B_2(z)/A_2(z), where
# 
#          B_1(z) = b10 + b11 * z^(-1) + b12 * z^(-2)
#          A_1(z) = 1 + a11 * z^(-1) + a12 * z^(-2)
# 
#      and equivalent for B_2(z) and A_2(z)
